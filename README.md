# DEPRECATED

This repository is the pre-AMM 1.0 standard repo for AMM core modules.  

The AMM 1.0 standard specifications havebeen published at https://github.com/advancedmodularmanikin/specification

The AMM 1.0-compliant Standard Library reference implementation has been published at https://github.com/AdvancedModularManikin/amm-library

A full developer's guide will also be released soon, as well as reference implementations for all AMM CORE software.


### This is the pre-release working proof-of-concept for AMM modules utilizing DDS. These examples are provided to be used as a reference to build your own AMM-compliant modules.

The [AMM_Modules](https://github.com/AdvancedModularManikin/DDS/tree/master/AMM_Modules) directory provides instructions on building the example modules.

The IDL directory contains the current [draft IDL](https://github.com/AdvancedModularManikin/DDS/blob/master/IDL/AMM.idl) being used.

The develop branch is working as of October 2019, although it is not AMM 1.0 Standards-compliant.
