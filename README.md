# DEPRECATED

This repository is the pre-AMM 1.0 standard repo for AMM core modules.  New libraries will be released soon which supercede this version and include improved building and development processes.  This will be updated when the new repositories are ready.



### This is the pre-release working proof-of-concept for AMM modules utilizing DDS. These examples are provided to be used as a reference to build your own AMM-compliant modules.

The [AMM_Modules](https://github.com/AdvancedModularManikin/DDS/tree/master/AMM_Modules) directory provides instructions on building the example modules.

The IDL directory contains the current [draft IDL](https://github.com/AdvancedModularManikin/DDS/blob/master/IDL/AMM.idl) being used.

The develop branch is working as of September 2019, although it is not AMM 1.0 Standards-compliant.
