# DDS

This is the current working proof-of-concept for AMM modules utilizing DDS. These examples are provided to be used as a reference to build your own AMM-compliant modules.

The [AMM_Modules](https://github.com/AdvancedModularManikin/DDS/tree/master/AMM_Modules) directory provides instructions on building the example modules.

The IDL directory contains the current [draft IDL](https://github.com/AdvancedModularManikin/DDS/blob/master/IDL/AMM.idl) being used.
